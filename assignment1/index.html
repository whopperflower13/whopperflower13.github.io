        <p class="answer" id="a1">I was zooming in on the browser, hoping zooming in on the background would trigger the webpage to progress. Finally I was able to figure out that resizing the width of the browser was the trigger, greeted by an animation of the sun rising as I narrowed the browser tab. It gave me insight on bringing the mobile ui into the pc browser.</p>

            <p class="answer" id="a3">I enjoyed the animation sequence in each scene the most. The irregular appearance triggers (start, interaction, secret) kept me entertained and focused. I found myself analysing the colors, sound, and animation while watching the short movies.</p>

                <p class="answer" id="a4">I spent most of my time simply admiring the audio and visuals, immersing myself in an italian summer dream from my cold melbourne home. I was panning around in search of the secret elements, or closing my eyes to dream of what summer would be.</p>

                <p class="answer" id="a5">I think the primary goal of this website is to provide the user with the ideal eternal summer experience, embracing the season, to make users crave for a summer getaway. They absolutely nailed it, making me want to travel to a warmer climate as soon as possible.</p>

                <p class="answer" id="a6">The audio and visuals strongly contribute to the primary goal, through the summer aesthetic of animation and music. The user is dragged into the experience through immersive audio features and an easter egg hidden to keep the users attention and providing the goal further contribution with interactivity.</p>

            <h3 class="question" id="q7">Q7 <span>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</span></h3>
            <p class="answer" id="a7">The more the experience is interacted with, the less time will be spent on the animation like i did, instead i was driven more to the scene view of each timeframe.
                I also headed to the product page to see how the inspiration (eternal summer) influenced the product (Richard Mille watch).

                <h3 class="question" id="q8">Q8 <span>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</span></h3>
                <p class="answer" id="a8">Yes. The interactive experience is largely connected to sound and controlling what the user sees. I think this choice keeps the interactive element less boring even toward the end of the experience and or future revisits to the website.</p>

                <p class="answer" id="a9">The watch and this advertisement campaign is inspired by Memphis Design, an Italian art movement from the 1980s. The watch was inspired by the vibrant and dynamic use of color and shape of Memphis design. Richard Mille has incorporated the design into their innovative and high performance watch products.</p>

                <h3 class="question" id="q10">Q10 <span>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</span></h3>
                <p class="answer" id="a10">The philosophy behind Memphis Design is what I look up to. The founding of this art movement was after the minimalist design style of the 1960s to 70s. The artist group’s dislike of minimalism had led to the creation of the design we know today. I want to keep a critical perspective on societal norms, and have a strong foundation and understanding of my philosophy and principles.</p>

                <p class="answer" id="a11">The keywords that come to mind are playful, adventurous, and explorative.
                    Additionally, I want the user to treat the experience as an opportunity to reflect on your own principles. Think objectively, how you would reinterpret the original experience and build it.

                <p class="answer" id="a12">Finding a way to enter the website start page was the biggest obstacle in this interaction.
                    The instructions were too vague, me and my friend misunderstood ‘resize browser’ as ‘zoom in’. <br>
                    Mobile centric design is sometimes hard to navigate with a mouse. I thought the overall idea was interesting, however, it requires some tweaking on the details for a seamless user experience.

                <p class="answer" id="a13">Progressing time to unlock a new scene and hunting for secret elements was the most satisfying part. Setting small goals throughout the interaction treated me with small rewards, and kept me immersed in the interaction. </p>
