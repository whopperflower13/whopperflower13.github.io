Here’s a summarized list of feedback for your next assignment:

1. Expand Answers: Provide more detailed responses to demonstrate a deeper experience of browsing the website.
2. Include Visuals: Use images or screenshots of the website to support your arguments and add context.
3. Enhance Font Choices: Pair the stylish font used for questions with a more sophisticated font for the body text. Ensure consistency in font sizing.
4. Use Semantic HTML Tags: Replace <div> tags with semantic tags like <section>, <main>, and <article> for better content structure. Use <h2> for questions and <p> for answers.
5. Improve Layout: Utilize flexbox and grid techniques for better layout design.
6. Optimize Hover Animations: Use hover animations sparingly, ideally for buttons or short text segments. Consider click-based transitions for larger text blocks.
7. Avoid Background Images: Prefer gradient colors over background images to reduce bandwidth load and improve reliability.
8. Revise Title and Header: Use a more descriptive title, e.g., “Review of Richard Mille’s 'Eternal Summer' Website,” and center-align the header text. Remove “Assignment 1” and “Interactive Media Research Project” from the heading.
