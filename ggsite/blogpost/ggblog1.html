                <h1>Birthday Queen!</h1>
                <p class="birthday">
                    While the city sheds its last winter shivers and the Met Gala's red carpet is being rolled out, a different kind of sparkle has captured our attention. As the magnolias bloom and the air fills with the promise of summer, one thing is certain: May brings with it the birthday of a certain someone who effortlessly outshines every blossoming flower on Park Avenue.
                </p>
                <p class="birthday">
                    Today, the spotlights aren't on the usual suspects. Our focus is squarely on a certain someone who's been navigating the treacherous waters of the social scene with all the grace of a true Waldorf.
                </p>

                <p class="birthday">
                    That's right, M is adding another year to her reign. And while some might be celebrating with humble cake and questionable company, we all know M deserves a birthday fit for a queen.
                </p>
                <p class="birthday">
                    Word on the very exclusive streets is that the festivities are already in full swing. We're talking perfectly chilled bubbly, a playlist curated with the precision of a Swiss watch, and a guest list that makes the Met Gala look like a PTA meeting. And as for the outfit? Whispers suggest it’s a creation so breathtaking, it would make even Blair herself nod in rare, appreciative approval.
                </p>
                <p class="birthday">
                    But let's be honest, M doesn't just attend parties, she is the party. With her sharp wit, impeccable style, and a knack for always knowing the juiciest gossip (sorry, darling, that's my job!), she's a force more formidable than a designer discount code.
                </p>
                <p class="birthday">
                    So, lift your crystal flutes—preferably filled with something bubbly and French—to the birthday girl! May her day overflow with more fabulousness than a sample sale at Barneys and less drama than a chance encounter with Chuck Bass.
                </p>
                <p class="birthday">
                    And to all you other social climbers and drama enthusiasts, keep your eyes peeled. Because with M in the spotlight, you never know what dazzling (or delightfully devious) things might happen next.
                </p>
                <p class="birthday" id="hbd">
                    Bonne anniversaire, M. Keep twirling, keep ruling, and remember: you're not just living the dream — you are the dream.
                </p>
